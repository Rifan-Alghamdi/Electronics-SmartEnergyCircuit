# 🔌 Electronics – Smart Energy Saving Circuits

This repository contains two separate circuits designed to demonstrate intelligent behavior for power efficiency and sensor applications using Arduino and basic electronic components.

## 🧠 Contents

# 1️⃣ -- [ Motion Controlled LED](./MotionControlledLED/)
- A system that detects motion using a PIR sensor and powers off automatically after a short timeout to conserve energy.

## 🔌 Circuit Overview

# 🔌 Electronics – Smart Energy Saving Circuits

This repository contains two separate circuits designed to demonstrate intelligent behavior for power efficiency and sensor applications using Arduino and basic electronic components.

## 🧠 Contents

### 1️⃣ [Motion-Controlled LED System](./Task1-MotionControlledLED)
- A system that detects motion using a PIR sensor and powers off automatically after a short timeout to conserve energy.

### 2️⃣ [Analog and Digital Sensors Simulation](./Task2-AnalogAndDigitalSensors)
- Demonstrates the difference in behavior between analog and digital sensors with simple output indicators (LEDs).

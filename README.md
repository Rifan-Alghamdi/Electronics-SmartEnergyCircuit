## 📦 Project Structure

### 1️⃣ [Motion-Controlled LED System](Electronics-SmartEnergyCircuit/MotionControlledLED)
A motion-activated LED system using a PIR sensor and manual activation button. The LED:

- Turns ON for 7 seconds upon pressing the button.
- Remains ON if motion is detected.
- Blinks 3 times and powers down when motion is no longer detected.

> ⚡ Purpose: Demonstrates intelligent power control using motion sensing.

### 2️⃣ [Analog and Digital Sensors Simulation](AnalogAndDigitalSensors/)
This task compares how analog and digital sensors behave in response to stimuli. Each sensor controls an LED to demonstrate:

- Analog sensor behavior (e.g., variable light intensity or range detection).
- Digital sensor behavior (simple ON/OFF threshold logic).

> 🔍 Purpose: Understand how Arduino reads and differentiates between analog and digital signals.
